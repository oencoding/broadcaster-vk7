# broadcaster-vk7 - broadcast scheduling and playback

This is a Linux server application that enables users to upload audio files and
schedule them for radio broadcast. It is designed to operate on a PC that is
also running IRLP/echolink nodes and shares their radio interface.

It is a project of the [Radio and Electronics Association of Southern
Tasmania](http://reast.asn.au).

## Status

The application is in early development. It is unlikely to be useful to anybody
except the people who are working on it.
